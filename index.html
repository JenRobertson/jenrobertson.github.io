            <a class="button-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JenRobertson/Peckin-Pixels">Play Game</a><a target="_blank" class="button-link" href="https://github.com/JenRobertson/Peckin-Pixels">Repo</a>
            <p>Peckin' Pixels is build using vanilla javascript and HTML canvas. No libraries or game engines were used, as I really enjoy making things from scratch.</p>
            <p>It is a drag and drop based game where you play as a chicken farmer. You must look after your chickens, raise their chicks or sell their eggs for profit. The chickens in the game make their own 'decisions'.</p>
            <p>All art and coding is done by me!</p>

            <p>Soft Swap is build using vanilla javascript and HTML canvas. No libraries or game engines were used, as I really enjoy making things from scratch.</p>
            <p>Use the mouse to select two toys to swap. If 3 or more of the same toy are touching, they dissapear. Look out for the powerups too!</p>
            <p>All art and coding is done by me, this time using Adobe Illustrator!</p>
